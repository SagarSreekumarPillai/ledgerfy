# Dashboard Sidebar UI Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the Ledgerfy dashboard sidebar, implementing modern UI/UX best practices and resolving the navigation issues that caused the sidebar to disappear and permissions to reset.

## Key Issues Resolved

### 1. **Navigation Problems**
- **Before**: Using `window.location.href` and `router.push()` in buttons caused full page reloads
- **After**: Implemented proper Next.js `Link` components for client-side navigation
- **Result**: Sidebar state is maintained during navigation, no more disappearing sidebar

### 2. **Permission Reset Issues**
- **Before**: Authentication context was being reset on each page navigation
- **After**: Improved auth context with better state management and caching
- **Result**: User permissions are preserved across route changes

### 3. **Poor User Experience**
- **Before**: Basic sidebar with limited functionality and poor mobile experience
- **After**: Modern, feature-rich sidebar with excellent mobile responsiveness
- **Result**: Professional-grade dashboard navigation experience

## New Features Implemented
